**This is an idea, not an full fledged website**
TrainBid is an innovative platform where travelers can secure train tickets even when they're officially sold out.
TrainBid pre-purchases a selection of tickets in advance, allowing users to bid on them as demand surges. When tickets are unavailable through regular channels, users can enter a bidding process to get a chance at securing their journey. 
The dynamic pricing model ensures fair access to tickets based on real-time demand, providing an alternative route for travelers looking to secure their seats even during peak times.
