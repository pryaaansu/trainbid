# TrainBid: Dynamic Train Ticket Bidding Platform

## Overview
**TrainBid** is an innovative platform designed to help travelers secure train tickets even when they are out of stock. The website allows users to place bids on pre-purchased train tickets as demand rises. When tickets are no longer available through traditional channels, the bidding process opens, enabling travelers to compete for available seats. This dynamic pricing model ensures fair access to tickets during high-demand periods, helping users travel with ease.
