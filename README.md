# TrainBid: Dynamic Train Ticket Bidding Platform

TrainBid is an innovative platform designed to help travelers secure train tickets even when they are out of stock. The website allows users to place bids on pre-purchased train tickets as demand rises. When tickets are no longer available through traditional channels, the bidding process opens, enabling travelers to compete for available seats. This dynamic pricing model ensures fair access to tickets during high-demand periods, helping users travel with ease.

## Features

- **Bid on Tickets**: Users can place bids for train tickets that are no longer available through regular purchase channels.
- **Pre-purchased Tickets**: The website buys a selection of tickets in advance, which are available for bidding when demand spikes.
- **Dynamic Pricing**: Ticket prices are determined through real-time bidding, allowing users to pay what they are willing to bid.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: A clean and easy-to-navigate platform for users to search, bid, and track ticket availability.
